instrumentation

event enter at FunctionDecl._ creates gen-enter from extract-function-info
// Statement-sort is used for all statements, the step-event has to be placed before the statement
event step at Statement._ creates gen-step from extract-statement-info

event exit at FunctionDecl._ creates gen-exit from extract-function-info
// FunctionDecl-sort is used for global and entity functions





// A function with arguments introduces new variables in the function scope.
// The var-events have to be placed before the enter event. When we enter we already want to know the arguments of the function.
// Therefore the var-instrumentation has to be executed after the enter-instrumentation
event var at FunctionDecl._ creates gen-function-argument from extract-function-argument-info

// introduces a new var in the current scope
event var at Statement.Declaration creates gen-var from extract-var-info
// changes the value of a variable
event var at Statement.AssignVar creates gen-var from extract-var-info
